                                    Introduction to Java

1)What is a class?

2)What is an object?

3)What is the difference between a class and an object in terms of memory?
Ans:A class is a logical entity but an object is a physical entity because an object 
occupies space in the memory.

4)JVM is platform dependent or independent?
Ans:Platform depedent.

5)Java is platform dependent or independent language?
Ans:Platform indepedent.

6)What are some features of java?

7)No.of dot class files created per each class-one.

8)Default value for int-0,char-space,string-null,boolean-false.

16)What is Typecasting?Types?
Ans:promoting one datatype to other.Types are widening and narrowing

17)Give some examples of java utilities?
Ans:javac,java,javah,javap,etc.

18)What do you mean by command line arguments?
Ans:arguments or parameters given in the command of program execution(java classname 34 45 67)

19)Why java is more oop than C++?
Ans:Because,in java main is also written inside the class.

20)Differences between C and Java?

21)Differences between C++ and java?

22)why java is slower than C?

26)What is the default package in java?
Ans:java.lang

27)What are the to create an object?
Ans:using new keyword,using deserialization,using object cloning,using reflection

                                  Pillars of Java
28)What is Encapsulation?

29)Best example of encapsulation?

                                 Variables

33)What is the difference between an instance variable,a static variable,a local variable.

Ans:Only one copy of static variables is avaible to all the objects.For each object,separate
copy of static variables is available.If a variable is recognized only in that block in 
which it is defined,then it is called as a local variable.


                                 Final Keyword

                                 Constructors

37)What is the purpose of a consrtuctor?
Ans:To initialize an object

38)The name of the constuctor is equal to?
Ans:classname

39)What are the differences between a method and a constructor?
Ans:Constructor-no return type,classname=constructor name

40)What are the types of constructor?
Ans:Parameterless and Parameterized.

41)If you dont write a constructor in your program,what JVM will do?
Ans:It will create a default constructor and uses it.

42)When a constructor be called?
Ans:AS soon as the object is created.

                              Destructors

43)What are Destructors in java?
Ans:Used to deallocate the resources of an object.

44)What is the method used which acts like destructors in java?
Ans:finalize()

45)When a destructor be executed on an object?
Ans:When there are no references for an object.

46)When a destructor be executed on an object?
Ans:Just before the object is garbage collected,destructors are executed.

47)Why destructors are not there in java?
Ans:Because the Garbage collection is done by JVM itself.

                            Garbage collection

48)What is Garbage collection?

49)Deallocating the memory of an object.

50)Performance of a garbage collector will depend on?
Ans:JVM performance.

51)What is garbage collection pause?
Ans:When garbage collection thread begins its execution,it stops all the apllication threads.After 
performing garbage collection,again it starts all the application threads.This delay is called as
Garbage Collection Pause.

52)Types of garbage collectors

53)Example of a serial and parallel gc?
Serial-Hotspot,parallel-JRocket.

54)To start gc process explicitly-
Ans:System.gc()


                           Dynamic method dispatch

55)What is Dynamic method dispatch?
Ans:Assigning a subclass object to a super class reference.

56)What did the term Dynamic in java?
Ans:At the time of execution.

                            this and super keywords

57)What is the purpose of this and super keywords?

58)What are the restrictions on this and super keywords---
Ans:super or this,if used, they should be the first statements in the constructor.
They cannot be used in methods only in constructors.
                            
                             static

59)What is the priority of the static block compared with main?
Ans:static blocks will be executed before main.

60)Limitation on static members.
Ans:A static member can access only other static members
Also they cannot use this and super 

61)From where the memory is allocated for the static variables?
Ans:From the static-pool.

62)What is the advantage of declaring a method as static?
Ans:We can directly access the members using the class name.

                              Abstract class
63)What is an abstract class?

64)What is an abstract method?

65)Can we create an object for an abstract class?

Ans:Thread class and Runnable interace

93)What is the lifecycle of a tread?
Ans:Newly born,runnable,running,dead.

94)What is the difference between sleep() and wait()?
Ans:In sleep(),we can specify the time upto which the thread should be inactive.But in wait()
time is not specified.So,we dont know how much time the thread is inactive.

104)What is critical section ?
Ans:That piece of code which is required to be executed by more than one thread.

105)What is starvation ?
Ans:A low priority thread is waiting for longer time to acquire the lock on the critical section.

106)What is the difference between a synchronized block and synchronized method ?
Ans : If we want to make whole method to be synchronized,then synchronized keyword is given for a 
method.If we want only some statements of a method to be synchronized,then we use synchronized block.

107)What are the types of locks?
Ans : Class level , Object level

108)If we want to acquire lock on whole class then for which method we have to give synchronized
keyword?
Ans:static method.
